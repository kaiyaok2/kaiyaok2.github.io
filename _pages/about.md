I am a first year **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), where I work with [Prof. Koushik Sen](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/) as a member of the Berkeley [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/).
My research interest lies in **AI for software engineering**, particularly in the integration of **large language models** for *automatic program repair* and *code translation*.

Before joining Berkeley, I obtained my **M.S. in Computer Science** from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I worked on **software testing** with [Prof. Darko Marinov](https://mir.cs.illinois.edu/marinov/), focusing on *flaky tests* and *test case prioritization*.  
I also worked with [Prof. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand](https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu/) on **neuro-symbolic models for software engineering**, particularly on *code translation*.

You can view my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) page for more details about my research and academic work.

Outside research, I’m interested in the intersection of programming languages and AI, and I enjoy exploring new tools that improve developer productivity and software reliability.
